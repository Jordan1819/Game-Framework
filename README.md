# Game-Framework
Author: Jordan Waite

# Overview
This game is a simple platformer style game where the player navigates the screen, jumps over obstacles, and collects stars (points) while trying to avoid enemy characters. This project utilizes the Python arcade module and many of the built in resources and methods. The development of this software involved drawing to a window, using inbuilt resources, collision detection, physics, and user input control. 

# How to Play:
The user can begin playing this game by simply running the main.py file in a code editor. The program will then open a new window and begin a new game. The player character can be controlled with the traditional arrow keys or with the WASD keys. The goal of the game is to collect as many stars as possible before being hit by one of the enemies.

# Purpose
My purpose in creating this software was to experiment and learn more about game development, the general file structure of games and complex software, and the basics of creating more interactive software. It has always been a dream of mine to independently develop, write, and publish a two dimensional retro RPG game with a meaningful story and immersive and complex mechanics. The old-school Final Fantasy games had a huge impact on my taste in video games, books, and my interest in programming in general. I would love to spark that interest and passion in someone else while also investing in a creative outlet through a medium that hones and improves my software development skills.

# Development Environment
This project was created in Microsoft Visual Studio Code and it is written in the Python programming language with the "arcade" Python module add-on.

# Future Work
* Add a point counter on the top of the screen.
* Add enemies that, if collided with, will initiate a GAME OVER screen and restart the game.
* Implement a level system where the player advances to a more difficult level once they've gathered all of the stars in the current level.
